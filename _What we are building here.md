What We're Really Building Here

The course promises to teach you tools. Fine. But what you actually need is a practical framework for turning ideas into functional prototypes that serve your specific monetization goals. The tools (Airtable, Glide, Adalo, Zapier) are just means to an end.

Rather than following someone else's 12-lesson sequence, let's build something more robust: a personalized learning architecture that moves from your actual use cases to working applications.

The Strategy (Slightly Different from Theirs)

Here's what I'm thinking...

Their approach: Learn tool A, then tool B, then tool C, then integration.

Our approach: Start with a real problem you're trying to solve (maybe a content management system for your courses? an affiliate link tracker? a student engagement dashboard?), then learn exactly the tools and techniques needed to build that specific thing.

This is precisely because you don't need to become a Glide expert—you need to become someone who can rapidly prototype solutions to your actual business problems.

The Learning Architecture

Phase 1: Foundation \& Environment (Weeks 1-2)



Set up your no-code toolkit

Understand the database-first thinking that underlies all these platforms

Map your existing workflows to potential app opportunities



Phase 2: Database Applications (Weeks 2-4)



Airtable as your source of truth

Building relational data structures

AI-enhanced data entry and management

Real project: Build a content pipeline tracker or course material database



Phase 3: Interface Layer (Weeks 4-6)



Glide for mobile-first interfaces

Adalo for more customized experiences

When to use which platform (this matters more than mastering both)

Real project: Student portal or content delivery app



Phase 4: Automation \& Integration (Weeks 6-8)



Zapier for connecting everything

Make.com as a potentially more powerful alternative

AI APIs for content generation and processing

Real project: Automated affiliate content generation + distribution



Phase 5: Deployment \& Iteration (Week 8+)



Publishing and user testing

Analytics and improvement

Turning prototypes into products people pay for



The Tactical Plan for Our Sessions

Each session would follow this pattern:



Concept introduction (10 min) - I explain the core idea conversationally

Live building (30-40 min) - You work in the tool, I guide you step-by-step, troubleshoot, explain why certain approaches work better

AI enhancement (10-15 min) - We figure out how to use Claude/ChatGPT/APIs to supercharge what you just built

Reflection \& next steps (5-10 min) - You tell me what clicked, what didn't, what you need next



Between sessions, you experiment. You come back with questions. We iterate.

Tools I'd Actually Recommend

The course mentions Airtable, Glide, Adalo, Zapier. All solid. But let me add some nuance:

Definitely use:



Airtable - phenomenal for database layer, integrates with everything

Make.com - more powerful than Zapier, better for complex workflows, has generous free tier



Consider instead of/alongside:



Softr or Glide - both excellent, Softr might fit your needs better for course delivery

Bubble instead of Adalo if you want more power (steeper learning curve though)

Notion databases + integrations - you might already be using Notion, could be your starting point



Definitely leverage:



Claude API (obviously) for content generation within your apps

Anthropic's prompt caching for cost-effective automation

Your existing AI toolkit to generate content, process data, create variations



What Makes This Better Than the Course?



Personalization - We build what you need, not generic examples

Integration - We connect this to your existing workflow and business model from day one

Depth - When you hit something interesting, we can go deeper instead of moving to the next lesson

Iteration - The course ends. This doesn't. As you build real products, we solve real problems



The course would teach you to build someone's app.

We're going to teach you to build your apps.

So... Should We Start?

I can develop detailed lesson plans for each phase, complete with specific exercises, projects, and checkpoints. I can create a resource library of templates and examples. I can troubleshoot your builds in real-time.
